# README

This repository contains code for our *Methods in Quantitative Biology* Final Project (signal processing on audio files to identify timestamps of bowel sounds).

**Please note**: the data itself is not stored in this Git repository (only the code）！

The data must be downloaded from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robertnowak/bowel-sounds](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robertnowak/bowel-sounds) into a directory called `data`. 

We can learn git from youtube
